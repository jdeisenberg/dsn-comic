[Panel 1]
Hey, Roberta, I keep seeing articles popping up all over about this thing.
What thing, Frank?

[Panel 2]
Something called “distributed social networks” I know what social networks are...

[Panel 3]
Those are sites like Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace.

[Panel 4]
But what’s the big deal about “distributed”? I have online friends from all over the place.

[Panel 5]
The “distributed” refers to where your data lives, and the big deal is that distributed networks put you in control.

[Panel 6]
Care to explain that in English?
=================

[dsn-comic02.svg]
[Panel 1]
Well, here’s how a typical social web site works. Let’s call it...
Hmm, how about...

[Panel 2]
FriendCenter!

[Panel 3]
Not very creative, but it’ll do.

[Panel 4]
Let’s say your friend Tuan makes a post to FriendCenter.
[in background on his computer:] It’s Pizza time!

[Panel 5]
His post goes to FriendCenter’s server.
[face icon:] Tuan
[computer:] Tuan’s Posts / It’s Pizza time!

[Panel 6]
Whoa! Don’t get all technical on me. What exactly is a server?
=================

[dsn-comic03.svg]
[Panel 1]
Just a huge computer (or a bunch of computers) that hold humongous amounts of data. It’s called a “server” because...

[Panel 2]
...when you ask the server for information, it goes into its “data kitchen” and serves up the data to you.

[Panel 3]
OK, got it. So Tuan makes a post and it goes to Friend-Center’s server.
[label on computer: FriendCenter server]

[Panel 4]
Now when you sign on to FriendCenter...

[Panel 5]
The server sees that Tuan is in your list of friends
[Face icon:] Frank
[on left side of screen] Tuan’s Posts / It’s Pizza time
[on right side of screen] Frank’s Friends / Maria Tuan Roberta

[Panel 6]
and serves Tuan’s message to you.
=================

[dsn-comic04.svg]
[Panel 1]
The illusion is that you are directly connected to Tuan and all your other friends.
[face icons clockwise from top:] Maria Tuan Sister Mom Dad Frank Roberta

[Panel 2]
In reality, the central server manages all of your interactions
[face icons clockwise from top same as in Panel 1]
[server label:] Server

[Panel 3]
So, how are these distributed social networks different?
With a distributed network, there’s no illusion.

[Panel 4]
Both you and Tuan have your own servers.
[servers from left to right:] Frank’s Server / Tuan’s Server

[Panel 5]
Tuan makes his post, and it goes to his server rather than a central server.
[on screen] Tuan’s Server / It’s Pizza time!
=================

[dsn-comic05.svg]
[Panel 1]
Your servers communicate directly with each other.
[Left screen] Frank's Server / My Friends / Maria Tuan Roberta
[Right screen] Tuan's Server / It’s Pizza time!

[Panel 2]
So that when you access your server, you see Tuan’s post.
[Face icon] Frank
[Left side of screen] Tuan’s Posts / It’s Pizza Time!
[Right side of screen] Frank’s Friends / Maria Tuan Roberta

[Panel 3]
What if I’m at my cousin George’s house? How do I get to my information?
You access your server from the web, so you can do it anywhere you have an internet onnection.

[Panel 4]
Data isn’t centralized- it’s distributed among all the users and their servers.
[Screens clockwise from left] Maria Tuan Sister Mom Dad Frank Roberta

[Panel 5]
Which is why they call it a distributed social network.

=================

dsn-comic06.svg
[Panel 1]
That’s right! In a distributed network, all the data would not be stored in one company’s server. There’s no single company in control.
[Screens clockwise from top left] Maria Tuan Sister Mom Dad Frank Roberta

[Panel 2]
What else makes it better?

[Panel 3]
First there’s privacy.  A centralized social network may give you only a few levels of privacy.
[on whiteboard] Everyone / Friends of friends only / Friends

[Panel 4]
If you want to set up your own groups of friends, you’re out of luck.
[on whiteboard] Everyone / Friends of friends only / Friends / Immediate Family  / Co-Workers/ Bowling Team

[Panel 5]
Also, FriendCenter may choose to change its privacy policies at any time...
=================

[dsn-comic07.svg]
[Panel 1]
...revealing information that you might not want others to see!

[Panel 2]
Yeah, I remember back in May 2010, one of the big social networks loosened up its privacy settings.

[Panel 3]
People weren’t very happy about that.

[Panel 4]
But with a distributed network, because it’s your server, you get to set up your own groups, and your privacy policy changes only when you want it to.
[on whiteboard] Everyone / Friends of friends only / Friends / Immediate Family  / Co-Workers/ Bowling Team

[Panel 5]
So that means the people on your bowling team don’t have to get messages about things going on at the office..
[on whiteboard] Co-Workers / Bowling Team

[Panel 6]
You also keep control of your data; it stays on your server.
Oh, I already keep copies of all my pictures on my hard disk
=================

[dsn-comic08.svg]
[Panel 1]
You’d be surprised how many people don’t. In any case, when you upload a photo to a centralized network, it goes to their server.

[Panel 2]
And that means your data is subject to their terms of service. Take a look at this:

[Panel 3]
You grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with FriendCenter.

[Panel 4]
Wow. I never knew that. Gives whole new meaning to “What’s mine is yours.”

[Panel 5]
With distributed social networks, “what’s yours is yours.”
=================

[dsn-comic09.svg]
[Panel 1]
Wait a moment. This article says that most of these distributed networks are “open source.” Does that mean that all of my data is open to the public?

[Panel 2]
“Open Source” just means that the software that runs the server is openly available for you to look at.

[Panel 3]
So you can see how the software was written and how it works.

[Panel 4]
Well, since I’m no programmer, there’s no danger of me messing with that!

[Panel 5]
Because your pictures and posts aren’t part of the software, your data is still all yours.
=================
[dsn-comic10.svg]
[Panel 1]
So distributed social networks have privacy and data ownership covered. What about security, now that I don’t have a middleman handling it for me?

[Panel 2]
The software encrypts all the traffic among the servers.
[on both screens] It’s [picture of pizza] time!

[Panel 3]
That keeps the bad guys from getting your data.

[Panel 4]
What about the social networks I use now? I can’t live without Farm Wars and Mafiaville and...

[Panel 5]
I got it. You don’t have to give up your current social networks. Since services like Facebook and Twitter allow programs to read data...
=================

[dsn-comic11.svg]
[Panel 1]
...your server will be able to access your data on your current social networks.
[label on server] SERVER

[Panel 2]
And they will also be able to integrate your server’s data.
[label on server] SERVER

[Panel 3]
But, of course, only if you permit them to.

[Panel 4]
This sounds great. But how come I haven’t heard of it before?

[Panel 5]
Most of the projects so far have been pretty small...
But in summer of 2010, one project named Diaspora caught everyone’s imagination.
That’s why you’re seeing all those articles now.
=================

[dsn-comic12.svg]
[Panel 1]
So, are these distributed networks ready to use right now?

[Panel 2]
Some projects are still in the planning stages.

[Panel 3]
Others are being built even as we speak.

[Panel 4]
And some are ready to move into.
So I can’t just go to a website and -presto- my computer becomes a server?

[Panel 5]
No. It’s preferable to set up a second computer to be your server.

[Panel 6]
That takes a bit of doing, but it’s a reasonable option for people who have that pioneer spirit.
=================

[dsn-comic13.svg]
[Panel 1]
Well, I’m no technical wizard! What choice do I have, then?

[Panel 2]
Some projects are under way to create a computer the size of a wall plug...

[Panel 3]
...that already has the software installed to make it act as a server for distributed social networks.

[Panel 4]
For example, the Freedom Box and FooPlug.
[first line on screen] http://wiki.debian.org/freedombox
[second line on screen] http://foocorp.org/projects/fooplug

[Panel 5]
FooPlug? Must have been some tech guy who came up with that name!

[Panel 6]
But it does sound interesting, and I’ll definitely keep an eye out for it. Just one more thing...

[Panel 7]
Roberta, when you start using distributed social networks- will you give me a friend request?
It’s a deal, Frank.
